Jawaker Card Counter is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our extension.

Data Collection and Use
We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from users directly through this extension. The only data we process is as follows:

Subscription Validation:
We use PayPal to process subscriptions. When you subscribe, PayPal sends a webhook containing a subscription ID. We use this subscription ID to match it with the user ID in our database solely for the purpose of validating your subscription status. This ensures you can access the features available to active subscribers.
Third-Party Services
Our extension integrates with the following third-party service:

PayPal:
We rely on PayPal for subscription processing. For more information about how PayPal handles your data, please refer to [PayPal's Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/paypal/privacy-full).
Data Storage and Retention
We do not store any personal data beyond the subscription ID and user ID required for subscription validation. These records are stored securely in our database and are automatically deleted when your subscription ends.

Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or trade your data with any third parties.

Security
We take data security seriously. All data is encrypted during transit and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.

Your Rights
Since we do not collect personal data directly from you, there are no additional data rights applicable. However, if you have any questions regarding your subscription or how PayPal processes your data, please contact PayPal directly.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, and the "Last Updated" date will reflect the most recent changes.
